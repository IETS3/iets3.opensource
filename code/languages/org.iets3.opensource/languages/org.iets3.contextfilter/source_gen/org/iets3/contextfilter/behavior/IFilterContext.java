/**
 * A filter context describes for a specific owner in which contexts it might be used.
 * 
 * E.g., a function might be called from various locations ("call sites"), these call sites
 * would be the filter contexts.
 * 
 * The user-facing id of a filter context is string label. It has to be unique for all
 * contexts for a given owner at a given point in time.
 * 
 * Filter contexts usually are transient and not part of the model and its node structure.
